# 👋 Hi, I’m Amarachi  
### Lawyer • Stay-At-Home Mom • Aspiring Python Developer

I started learning Python to make everyday life more organized — from grocery lists to meal planning to family routines. Over time, I realized how programming can also support my work as a lawyer through better workflows and simple automations. I’m learning steadily and building practical tools along the way.
